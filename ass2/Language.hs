Exercise 4
----------
What can you find out from the Happy documentation over Happyâ€™s handling of left-recursive and right-recursive grammars.

Happy is more efficient when handling left-recursive rules because they result in a constant stack-space parser.
The right-recursive rules require stack space proportional to the length of the list being parsed,
this is especially problematic with long sequences, as these can fail due to a lack of stack space [1].

The current Happy code implements the standard GLR algorithm extended to handle hidden left recursion.
Cyclic grammers, however, are not supported [2].

How does this compare to the situation when using parser combinators?

When using parser combinators, left-recursion results in an infinite loop when parsing.
Parser combinator vs Parser Generator (Happy).
